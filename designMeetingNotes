---------------------------------------------
You need to make the desision for having pointers to the other player and
each objective on the screen, or have a minimap. Each has their pros/cons
as we discussed. You may want to rethink your scoring situation. I'm not
sure if it will be too difficult for a player to get both flags at once to
win. You may want to go with the more traditional way of scoring this game
and time how long each player has the flag, and set some goal time to win
(maybe 1-3 minutes?). -eakeller

Checklist for how we handled suggestions:
	- Implemented pointers, and not minimaps

	- Went from a score when both flags are at base design to simply
	running the opponents flag to your base no matter where yours is

	- 2 Minute time limit
